# ARGOS – Autonomous Operations Framework

ARGOS is an experimental framework for **autonomous operations and incident remediation** in hybrid infrastructure environments.

The project explores how operational systems can detect incidents, decide corrective actions and execute remediation automatically through a **closed-loop operational model**.

ARGOS is designed as part of the **AEGIS ecosystem**, where:

- **DAEDALUS** defines and generates infrastructure designs (LLD automation)
- **AEGIS** governs identity, access and policy enforcement
- **ARGOS** performs autonomous operational remediation

---
## Architecture Overview

ARGOS implements a **closed-loop operational model** for autonomous remediation.


The system processes operational events and applies corrective actions automatically while maintaining auditability.

Core components:

- **Detector** – collects and normalizes operational events
- **Decision Engine** – determines remediation actions based on rules
- **Action Engine** – executes corrective actions
- **Verification** – validates system recovery
- **Audit Log** – records operational decisions and results

## Core Concept

ARGOS implements a simple closed-loop model:
Detect → Decide → Act → Verify

Typical flow:

```text
Event / Alert
│
▼
Detection Engine
│
▼
Decision Engine
│
▼
Action Engine
│
▼
Verification
│
▼
Audit Log
```

This model allows ARGOS to respond automatically to operational incidents such as:

- Service failures
- Network issues
- Certificate lifecycle problems
- Infrastructure anomalies

---

## Project Status

ARGOS is currently in **early experimental stage (v0.1)**.

The first goal is to implement a minimal autonomous remediation loop:

- Event detection
- Rule-based decision engine
- Scripted remediation actions
- Verification checks
- Incident logging

Future versions will explore integration with observability systems such as:

- Prometheus
- Alertmanager
- Log pipelines

## Vision

The long-term goal of ARGOS is to explore **autonomous infrastructure operations**, where systems are capable of detecting anomalies and safely applying remediation actions under controlled policies.

This research is aligned with emerging concepts such as:

- AIOps
- Self-healing infrastructure
- Autonomous systems
- Zero Trust operational governance

## Project Status

ARGOS is currently in **experimental stage (v0.1)**.

Current goals:

- implement a minimal autonomous remediation loop
- integrate rule-based decision engine
- validate operational verification mechanisms

Future exploration includes:

- Prometheus / Alertmanager integration
- AI-assisted decision support
- integration with AEGIS Identity Fabric
