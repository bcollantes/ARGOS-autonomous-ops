# ARGOS – Autonomous Operations Framework

ARGOS is an experimental framework for autonomous operations and incident remediation in hybrid infrastructure environments.

The project explores how operational systems can detect incidents, decide corrective actions and execute remediation automatically through a closed-loop operational model.

ARGOS is designed as part of the AEGIS ecosystem, where:

- **DAEDALUS** defines and generates infrastructure designs (LLD automation)

- **AEGIS** governs identity, access and policy enforcement

- **ARGOS** performs autonomous operational remediation

## Architecture Overview

ARGOS implements a closed-loop operational model for autonomous remediation.

The system processes operational events and applies corrective actions automatically while maintaining auditability.

## Core components

- **Detector** – collects and normalizes operational events
- **Decision Engine** – determines remediation actions based on rules
- **Policy Engine** – evaluates whether actions can be executed
- **Action Engine** – executes corrective actions
- **Verification** – validates system recovery
- **Audit Log** – records operational decisions and results

## Core Concept

ARGOS implements a closed-loop model:

Detect → Decide → Act → Verify

Detection Engine
│
▼
Context Builder
│
▼
Decision Engine
│
▼
Policy Engine
│
▼
Action Engine
│
▼
Verification
│
▼
Audit Log
```
This model allows ARGOS to respond automatically to operational incidents such as:

- ervice failures

- Network issues

- Certificate lifecycle problems

- Infrastructure anomalies

## Execution Pipeline

Running **ARGOS**

ARGOS can be executed as a modular pipeline simulating real operational environments.

python -m argos.main --env=<environment>

### Supported environments

```text
dev → development
tst → testing / pre-production
acc → acceptance / certification
prd → production
```
---
### Execution Modes by Environment
Execution Modes by Environment

```text
dev → full autonomy (auto-execution)
tst → confirmation required before execution
acc → approval required (controlled execution)
prd → strict approval required (policy-driven execution)
```
### Example

python -m argos.main --env=prd

```text
[DETECTOR] Detected incident: [service_down] target=payments-api severity=high
[CONTEXT] Built context: {'environment': 'prd', 'retry_count': 0}
[MAIN] Running in environment: prd
[DECISION] Action decided: restart_service
[POLICY] Evaluating policy for env=prd
[EXECUTION] PRD mode → approval required for restart_service
Approve execution? (y/n): y
Restarting service: payments-api
[VERIFY] Incident resolved
[AUDIT] Logging incident
```

## Project Status

ARGOS is currently in experimental stage (v0.1).

### Current goals:

- Event detection
- Context enrichment
- Rule-based decision engine
- Policy-controlled execution
- Scripted remediation actions
- Verification checks
- Incident logging

### Future exploration includes:

- Prometheus / Alertmanager integration
- Loki / Kafka event ingestion
- Distributed tracing (Tempo)
- Runbook automation
- AI-assisted decision support

The implementation is written in Python and focuses on simplicity, modularity and extensibility.

## Vision

The long-term goal of ARGOS is to explore autonomous infrastructure operations, where systems are capable of:

- detecting anomalies
- reasoning about corrective actions
- applying remediation safely
- operating under controlled policies

This aligns with emerging concepts such as:

- AIOps
- Self-healing infrastructure
- Autonomous systems
- Zero Trust operational governance

## Runbook Classification Model

- **A1** — Low criticality operational procedures
- **A2** — Medium criticality service recovery procedures
- **A3** — High availability remediation workflows
- **A4** — Critical operational runbooks requiring functional and capacity validation

### A4 additional controls

- strict approval policy
- enhanced auditability
- mandatory capacity validation
- k6-based endpoint stress verification
